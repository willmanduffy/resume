# This is my resume!

## Building the Source

#### Mac Instructions
* Install [MacTex](https://tug.org/mactex/). They recommend you download with Safari.
* Confirm that `pdflatex` is in your path with `which pdflatex`.
* If not, something along these lines should work `cd /usr/local/bin && sudo ln -s /usr/texbin/pdflatex`.
* Compile the resume with `pdflatex resume.tex`.
* Voila!

In Linux you just install a full TexLive (just to be safe) and follow the same instructions. For Windows... it's been so long I can be of no help. TexLive for Windows should help you out.

# License

This is a fork of [Daniel Cousineau's resume](https://github.com/dcousineau/resume). He created this wonderful app and I just updated the readme a bit. All credit goes to him.

My licensing terms are thus: You are allowed to take my code whole-sale and produce your own resume. For obvious reasons you may not reuse any of the content (such as skills, etc) but do with the formatting as you will. If you use my source to build your resume, I would love a link to your resume to see what you did differently (usually better).
